    "Naver Map. Use naver_map__search_place for a plain keyword search "
    "anywhere. Use naver_map__search_nearby to search around a specific center "
    "point (an entity_id like a zone/person/device_tracker, or a "
    "latitude/longitude), passing exactly one of category or query. Use "
    "naver_map__geocode_address to convert an address string to coordinates. "
    "Use naver_map__get_directions for a route between an origin and "
    "destination (each an entity_id or latitude/longitude), with optional "
    "waypoints in order; pick mode 'car', 'transit' (public transit), 'walk', "
    "or 'bicycle'. duration/distance/arrival_time may be null when the "
    "best-effort route lookup fails — the route_url link is still valid. "
